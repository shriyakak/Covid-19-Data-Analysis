## Task 2: Using SIR model for prediction of Covid-19 infection and recovery rate for individual country.

#### Steps to execute Task 2

* After cloning the Covid-19-Data-Analysis repository, navigate to **src** folder and execute below command
```
python visualize_SIR.py
```
* The Dashboard will run on localhost at port - 8052. (Click the link generated after above command)
* Note: To use the population data for SIR modelling a new dataset file called population.csv is used. It is placed under data/population.csv
